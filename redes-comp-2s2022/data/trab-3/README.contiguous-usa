Contiguous USA network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the contiguous-usa network: These are the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia of the United States of America (the USA).  They include all states except the states of Alaska and Hawaii, which are not connected by land with the other states, and include the District of Columbia (DC).  An edge denotes that two states share a border.  The US states in the configuration given by this dataset exist since February 14, 1912, when Arizona was admitted as the 48th state, and is current as of 2014.  The states of Alaska and Hawaii were admitted as the 49th and 50th states in 1959, but are not contiguous with the other states, and are not reflected in this dataset. 


More information about the network is provided here: 
http://konect.cc/networks/contiguous-usa

Files: 
    meta.contiguous-usa -- Metadata about the network 
    out.contiguous-usa -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.contiguous-usa are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
